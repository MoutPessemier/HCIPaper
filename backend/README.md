# Backend

### Getting Started

1. The first step you have to do is clone the main repository with both the frontend and backend in. To do this, type into your command propmpt: `git clone https://github.com/MoutPessemier/HCIPaper.git`.
2. Once the repository has been cloned, jump to the backend folder: `cd backend/`.
3. When in the backend folder, install all packages and dependencies using: `pip install...`.

You can now start to develop from the backend branch

### Spinning Up The Serve

To spin the server up locally, jump to `/app/` (`cd app/`) and run `python app.py`

To spin up the server in a docker container, stay in the backend root folder and run `docker-compose up -d`
